    The |project| reasoning pipeline.

|project| is an intelligent, cognitive assistant system that supports materials scientists in developing novel
materials. |project| combines modern machine learning techniques with machine-interpretable semantic knowledge in order
to model representations of relationships between materials, processes and properties and allow reasoning about them.
Given a requirement profile, the system generates suggestions on how these criteria can be achieved.

You can integrate |project| in your own `Python` project. If you are a developer, see :doc:`setup` for
examples how to execute learning and reasoning and :doc:`setup` for further documentation.

If you are a user, go to :doc:`setup` to find out how to use the online tools in |project|'s web interface for help with the command-line tools.
