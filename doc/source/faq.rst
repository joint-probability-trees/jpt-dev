Frequently Asked Question
=========================

What is the difference between Sum Product Networks (SPNs) and JPTs?
    SPNs define dependency trees and JPTs define computational trees. In a dependency tree edges between variables indicate a direct influence. In a computational tree it is just a merge of formulas.
