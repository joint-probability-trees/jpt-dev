Overview
********
The JPT package brings reliable, expressive, efficient and interpretable joint probability distributions to everyone.

Supported types of inference are:
    - Full evidence queries
    - Marginal queries
    - Conditional queries
    - Expectations
    - Most probable explanations
    - Confidence intervals

Installation
************

Install the package with

``pip install jpt``

or clone the repository and install with

``python setup.py install``

Currently the package is only supported and tested for Ubuntu 18+, but *theoretically* it should be working
for other operating systems too.
